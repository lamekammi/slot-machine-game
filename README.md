# Slot Machine Game
***

The Slot Machine Game ( SMG ) is a web browser game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to resemble a slot machine you might see at a Casino. When the Lever button is clicked it will go through an array of images and stop after 6 seconds. Typically a slot machine you might see at a Casino will have points and you would spend these points to try and gain *more* points, BUT this Slot Machine Game is to only see if you win or lose. 

### Fun Facts
***

- The first mechanical slot machine was invented in 1894 by Charles August Fey.
- Winning myths to slot machines are only myths.
- There is more slot machines in Japan than the United States.
- Taxes made slot machines popular because of increase in taxes places of business needed to find a     different way to generate more income.

The SMG is easy to start all you got to do is click the "Lever" button.
If you want to Reset the game or scoreboard click the "Reset Game" button.
You need 3 of the same heart to win, if not you lose!
There is also instructions on the actual game browser just incase.

# Next Steps
***

In the future I would like to add more to the SMG. I am hoping after I learn more from my SEI Program at GA I can implement these items and amplify this SMG.

Here is the list:

- Adding fun animations during the ``spin()`` function and the ``win()`` ``lose()`` functions.
- Adding sound effects to those functions above as well.
- Letting you pick what kind of slot machine, meaning you pick a theme that the array images will be to make it more fun and enjoyable for the user playing the game.
